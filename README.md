## Description
> This is a show case of my Tech journey.  Snippets of my personal adventure that's lead me to the love of coding.  This profile page has been re-done from basic HTML and CSS to include the very exciting React and JavaScript Components. Feel free to take a look around, and click away on all my recent projects and accomplishments. More to come!!

> Check out my profile page [Here](https://catupperman.github.io/cats-react-profile/).

## Installation
> I started by installing [React](https://reactjs.org/) into my application by following the instructions. Once the lovely spinning react image appeared on the page, I began messing with the structure. 
Applications used to create this profile: 
> * node 
> * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
> * [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
> * [Shields IO](https://shields.io/category/license) 
> * [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) 
> * [React](https://reactjs.org/)
## Contributions
> My tutor in school helped in understanding the basics, somethings I found a bit elusive when starting to work with React. React can be very picky, especially when it comes to pictures. Once, I was able to get a handle on the application process, I have been toying with and tinkering with styling.  Only increasing my capabilities using React. I would also like to thank my classmate Jose for always helping me with React like questions or taking the time to help me research what exactly was going wrong. 
## Testing
> To test this application I would start the application throught the terminal with the command 'npm run start' once it appears on the webpage I would tinker with different methods to make the website visually appealing.
